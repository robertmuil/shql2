Add constraints to columns. This will require a rewrite of the insert and
update handlers.  The constraints can easily be added to the header file after
the column type with a tab. Probably writing the data to a temp file then
running a small AWK script to check and add the data would work. For inserts
from select statements the select into functionality could be used.

Date and boolean data types would be nice. This would also affect insert. Dates
could be stored as seconds since epoc adjusted for GMT + original timezone.
This would allow correct sorting of dates/times regardless of timezone.

Fails on dash: so does not work on systems that link /bin/sh to this.
